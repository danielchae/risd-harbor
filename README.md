## Description
I've wanted to redesign WebAdvisor since Freshman year but never had the time to do it. UI is outdated and cumbersome and UX leaves a lot to be desired. WebAvisor was first created by Datatel in the 80's when web design was a game of how many tables can be nested within each other. Considered just writing a plugin that could inject my own stylesheet into WebAdvisor but I'd like to just build it from the ground up.
